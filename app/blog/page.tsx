        I've created the first three pages (Özellikler, Onarım Servisleri, and Yorumlar) with complete content and
        proper Turkish SEO optimization. Each page follows the same design language as your main landing page with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Özellikler (Features)</strong> - Detailed feature breakdown with benefits and statistics
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Onarım Servisleri (Repair Services)</strong> - Comprehensive service listings with pricing and
          specifications
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Yorumlar (Testimonials)</strong> - Customer reviews with verification badges and detailed feedback
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Would you like me to continue with the remaining pages (Hakkımızda, Blog, Kariyer, Garanti, iPhone Onarım, iPad
        Onarım, MacBook Onarım)? I can create them with the same level of detail and Turkish content optimization.
      </p>
